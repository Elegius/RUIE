TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions

"This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

"Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works.

"The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License.

"You" refers to each licensee.

"Legal entities" means the union of the acting entity and all other entities
that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity.

"Licensee" is you, the person receiving this work.

1. Source Code

The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.

2. Basic Permissions

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright
on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met.
This License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License
only if the output, by its nature, constitutes a covered work.

3. Copyleft / Derivative Works

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions, so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running these works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License.

All rights not expressly granted are reserved.

4. Distribution

When you distribute copies of the Program or derivative works, you must:
- Give the recipients all the source code
- Make clear what changes you made
- Keep all notices of this License and any non-permissive terms
- Keep intact all warranties and liability disclaimers

5. Restrictions

You are not allowed to:
- Restrict the further rights of the recipient
- Charge any fee beyond the cost of physically transferring the copy
- Require acceptance of additional restrictions

6. Patents

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under their essential patent claims.

7. Additional Terms

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement this License by making
exceptions from one or more of its conditions. When you convey a copy of a
covered work, you may at your option remove any additional permissions from
that copy, or from any part of it.

If you distribute copies of the covered work, whether gratis or for a fee, you
must pass on the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they,
too, receive or can get the source code.

8. Termination

If you violate this License, your rights are terminated. However, if you cease
all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright
holder is reinstated provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder
explicitly and finally terminates your license.

9. Acceptance Not Required

You do not have to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the
Program. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to
propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.

Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License.

11. Protection of Users' Legal Rights

This License is intended to make sure that freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
